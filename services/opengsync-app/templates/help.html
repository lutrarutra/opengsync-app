    <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle"></i> About</h2>
    <p>
        This program is designed to store and facilitate the transfer of information between customers and our team. It
        is not intended for designing or validating experimental setups. Users must ensure that their experimental
        setups are valid. If you are uncertain about your setup, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}">{{ contact_email }}</a>.
        Each sequencing request is subject to review and approval by the our team. For non-standard experimental setups,
        such as using a custom genome reference, please contact us to ensure we can accommodate your request.

    <h3>Sequencing Request</h3>
    <p>
        Customers can submit a sequencing request. The request defines samples, libraries, and pools
        that the customer wants to sequence. Users can submit two types of requests: <b>raw samples</b>
        <span class="desc">library preparation + sequencing</span> and <b>ready-to-sequence pooled libraries</b>
        <span class="desc">only sequencing</span>. Each sequencing request can be associated with a single group, e.g. research lab or a group of collaborators.
        You can create a new group in <a href="{{ url_for('groups_page.groups') }}" target="_blank">Groups</a>-page.
        Results from each request will be shared with a single entity,
        whether it is a research lab or an individual and their optional collaborators. If you are submitting a request on behalf
        of multiple entities, e.g. two non-related projects from different groups, please
        submit separate requests for each entity. Results from different requests, including previous ones
        <span class="desc">e.g. re-sequencing</span>, can be
        grouped together for analysis by associating the samples with the same project. This is achieved by selecting
        an existing project and defining sample with a same 'sample_name' from existing project during sample/library
        annotation.
    </p>

    <h3>Project</h3>
    <p>
        Project is a collection of samples. Samples from same project are analysed and shared together. Project can
        include samples from different sequencing requests.
    </p>

    <h3>Sample</h3>
    <p>
        Sample <span class="desc">biosample/specimen</span> is a biological material that is prepared into a library and
        sequenced. Samples can contain metadata information such as tissue, sex, genotype etc. Each sample can be
        prepared into one or more libraries.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    {% for status in SampleStatus.as_list() %}
        <li><b>{{ status.display_name }}</b>: {{ status.description }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Library</h3>
    <p>
        Library is a sample that has been prepared for sequencing. Libraries are pooled before sequencing. Each library
        has a type that is defined by the library preparation workflow. Each library is associated to a single
        sequencing
        request. Sequenced bases, fastq-files, are shared with recipients indicated in request's 'share'-tab. Library
        can only be pooled and sequenced once. If you need to re-sequence a sample, new library will be
        created from that sample. Samples can be multiplexed in a same library, e.g. using 10X sample multiplexing
        hash-tag-oligos (HTOs).
    </p>
    <ul>
    {% for status in LibraryStatus.as_list() %}
        <li><b>{{ status.display_name }}</b>: {{ status.description }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Pool</h3>
    <p>
        Pool is a collection of libraries that are sequenced together. A pool can be sequenced on multiple lanes of a
        flowcell. Pool can be associated to only a single experiment; on re-sequencing, pool and libraries are cloned.
    </p>
    <ul>
    {% for status in PoolStatus.as_list() %}
        <li><b>{{ status.display_name }}</b>: {{ status.description }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
